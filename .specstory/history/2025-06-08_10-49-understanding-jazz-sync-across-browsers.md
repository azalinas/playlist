# Understanding jazz sync across browsers (2025-06-08 18:49:07)

_**User**_

i have this starter project using jazz, a local first sync tool that you should have the docs for (do you?). help me understand how it works. i see that if i upload a file, it's available on the same browser, but not when i navigate to a different browser. isn't it supposed to work crossplatform? what's going on

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is asking about Jazz, which they describe as a "local first sync tool." They're experiencing an issue where files uploaded in one browser are available in the same browser but not when they navigate to a different browser. They're wondering why it's not working cross-platform/cross-browser.

Let me think about what I know about Jazz:

Jazz is indeed a local-first sync framework. From what I understand, Jazz handles data synchronization across devices and browsers, but there are some key concepts about how it works:

1. **Account/Identity Management**: Jazz typically requires some form of account or identity system to sync data across different browsers/devices. Without proper account setup, data might only persist locally.

2. **Sync Infrastructure**: Jazz needs a sync server or peer-to-peer connection to share data between different browsers/devices.

3. **Browser Storage**: Data might be stored locally in each browser's storage, and without proper sync setup, it won't be available in other browsers.

The user is asking if I have access to Jazz docs - I should be honest about what I know and suggest they check their setup.

The issue they're describing sounds like either:
- No account/authentication system set up
- No sync server configured
- The app is only using local storage without the sync functionality properly configured

I should ask for more details about their setup and provide general guidance about how Jazz sync typically works.</think>I have some familiarity with Jazz as a local-first sync framework, but I don't have access to the complete current documentation. Let me help you understand what's likely happening with your cross-browser sync issue.

The behavior you're describing - files being available in the same browser but not across different browsers - suggests that **data is only being stored locally** rather than being synced through Jazz's sync infrastructure. Here are the most common reasons this happens:

## Likely Causes:

1. **No Account/Authentication Setup**: Jazz typically requires users to have an account or identity to sync data across devices/browsers. Without this, data stays in the local browser storage.

2. **Missing Sync Server Configuration**: Jazz needs a sync server (or peer connections) to share data between different browsers/devices.

3. **App Only Using Local Storage**: Your app might be configured to only use Jazz's local storage capabilities without enabling the sync features.

## To Debug This:

Can you share:
- How your Jazz app is initialized? (especially the sync/server configuration)
- Whether you have any account/authentication system set up?
- Your Jazz configuration code?

## Quick Check:
Look for something like:
```typescript
// This would be local-only
const jazz = createJazzApp({ ... })

// vs sync-enabled which might look like:
const jazz = createJazzApp({ 
  auth: ...,
  sync: { server: "..." },
  // or peer configuration
})
```

If you can share your Jazz setup code, I can help identify why the sync isn't working across browsers. The cross-platform sync is definitely a core feature of Jazz, so there's likely just a configuration step missing.

i've added the clerk auth example to the repository. please take a look at it @clerk to see how i should adapt my current code to include authentication

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is showing me a folder with a Clerk authentication example, and they want me to understand how to adapt their current code to include authentication. They mentioned this is related to their Jazz local-first sync issue - where data isn't syncing across browsers. This makes sense because Jazz likely needs authentication to sync data across different browsers/devices.

Let me first explore the clerk folder to understand the structure and see how authentication is implemented, then look at their current code to see how to adapt it.</think>I'll help you understand how to integrate Clerk authentication into your Jazz app. Let me first explore the Clerk example to see how it's structured and then look at your current code.

Perfect! Now I understand the issue and how to fix it. Your current Jazz app is **not using authentication**, which is why data only stays in the local browser and doesn't sync across different browsers.

## The Problem

Your current setup in `src/main.tsx` uses `JazzProvider` without any authentication:

```typescript
<JazzProvider
  sync={{
    peer: `wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=${apiKey}`,
  }}
  AccountSchema={JazzAccount}
>
```

This creates **anonymous local accounts** that can't sync across browsers because there's no way to identify the same user across different browser sessions.

## The Solution

Here's how to integrate Clerk authentication to enable cross-browser sync:

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

First, add the Clerk packages to your `package.json`:

```json:package.json
{
  // ... existing content ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@clerk/clerk-react": "^5.4.1",
    "jazz-react": "workspace:*",
    "jazz-react-auth-clerk": "workspace:*", // Add this
    "jazz-tools": "workspace:*",
    "jazz-inspector": "workspace:*",
    "react": "19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "19.0.0"
  },
  // ... rest of file ...
}
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (or update existing one) with your Clerk publishable key:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
```

### 3. Update Your Main Entry Point

Replace your current `src/main.tsx` with this authenticated version:

```typescript:src/main.tsx
import { ClerkProvider, useClerk } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import { JazzInspector } from "jazz-inspector";
import { JazzProviderWithClerk } from "jazz-react-auth-clerk";
import { ReactNode, StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import { apiKey } from "./apiKey.ts";
import "./index.css";
import { JazzAccount } from "./schema.ts";

// Import your publishable key
const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Add your Clerk publishable key to the .env file");
}

function JazzProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const clerk = useClerk();

  return (
    <JazzProviderWithClerk
      clerk={clerk}
      sync={{
        peer: `wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=${apiKey}`,
      }}
      AccountSchema={JazzAccount}
    >
      <JazzInspector />
      {children}
    </JazzProviderWithClerk>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY} afterSignOutUrl="/">
      <JazzProvider>
        <App />
      </JazzProvider>
    </ClerkProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

### 4. Update Your App Component

Modify your `src/App.tsx` to handle authentication state:

```typescript:src/App.tsx
import { SignInButton, SignOutButton } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import { useAccount, useIsAuthenticated } from "jazz-react";
import { FileWidget } from "./FileWidget.js";
import { Logo } from "./Logo.tsx";

function App() {
  const { me } = useAccount();
  const isAuthenticated = useIsAuthenticated();

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      <main className="container mt-16 flex flex-col gap-8">
        <Logo />
        <div className="text-center">
          <h2 className="text-xl mb-4">Sign in to sync your files across devices</h2>
          <SignInButton />
        </div>
      </main>
    );
  }

  return (
    <main className="container mt-16 flex flex-col gap-8">
      <Logo />
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
        <p>Welcome back, {me?.profile?.name || 'User'}!</p>
        <SignOutButton>Sign Out</SignOutButton>
      </div>
      <FileWidget />
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## How This Fixes Cross-Browser Sync

With Clerk authentication:

1. **User Identity**: Each user gets a persistent identity that works across browsers
2. **Account Linking**: Jazz can now link the same user account across different browser sessions
3. **Data Sync**: Files uploaded in one browser will sync to other browsers when the same user signs in

## Next Steps

1. **Get a Clerk Account**: Sign up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and get your publishable key
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` after updating package.json
3. **Test**: Try uploading a file in one browser, then sign in with the same account in another browser - your files should now sync!

The key insight is that **Jazz needs user authentication to enable cross-device/cross-browser sync**. Without it, each browser session creates its own isolated local account.
